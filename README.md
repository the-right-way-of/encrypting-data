# Encrypting data

### Base64

Base64 is not encryption, its encoding. Basically, you can employ any bitwise encoding scheme as encryption and escape most of the management.

Think about it! If no one knew it is base64, then no one can read it. It would become an encryption algorithm in that case, wouldn't it? 
There are others, like base36, which encode to numbers only. Less people know about it, hence, it is better and harder to guess.

### What is encryption?

When you don't know what somebody did to change the original text, you can't interpret it. It means you have encrypted the data.
I speak english, I don't know chinese. If there are people talking in chinese, I am not able to interpret what they are speaking, you could say they have setup an encrypted communication channel. 

#### But how would I learn chinese?

That's what is called breaking the encryption. You need to learn the language to be able to interpret it. You can either:

- Learn every character and know what it means when it appears
- Learn syllables and make an interpretation with the order of words

### The best encryption

Lesser the number of people who know about it, better the algorithm. Computers can crack everything you give them, provided you know how to operate them. 
You need to be really creative for that to happen. If you're good at learning foreign languages, you would be better at breaking encryption.
People say that all asymmetric-key encrypted traffic will become unencrypted when Quantum computers reach a certain level.
There will always be a solution to the problem that you create because you created it and there is always somebody else who would be able to solve it.

### Enigma problem

Till the time Germans were the only ones who knew about the language, they were considered elite in warfare.
The sequence of patch chords and starting position were the things that were important.
There was no flaw in the algorithm whatsoever, it was just that we didn't know how to read that language until the time somebody figured a way to make sense out of the garbled text.
